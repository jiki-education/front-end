  "instructions": "You're building a Scrabble bot. Before the bot tries to play a word, it needs to check whether it has a specific letter tile in its rack.\n\nThe rack is represented as a list of single-letter strings (e.g. `[\"S\", \"C\", \"R\", \"A\", \"B\"]`).\n\nWrite a function called `contains` that takes two inputs:\n- `haystack`: the list of tiles in the rack\n- `needle`: the letter to search for\n\nReturn `true` if the letter is in the rack, or `false` if it isn't.\n\nExamples:\n- `contains([\"S\", \"C\", \"R\", \"A\", \"B\"], \"A\")` returns `true`\n- `contains([\"S\", \"C\", \"R\", \"A\", \"B\"], \"Z\")` returns `false`\n- `contains([], \"A\")` returns `false`",
