  "instructions": "Scrabble is a word game where players place letter tiles on a board to form words. Each letter has a value, and a word's score is the sum of its letters' values.\n\nYour task is to compute a word's Scrabble score by summing the values of its letters.\n\nThe letters are valued as follows:\n\n- A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T = 1 point\n- D, G = 2 points\n- B, C, M, P = 3 points\n- F, H, V, W, Y = 4 points\n- K = 5 points\n- J, X = 8 points\n- Q, Z = 10 points\n\nCreate two functions:\n\n1. `letter_values()` - Returns a dictionary where each key is an uppercase letter and each value is its point value.\n\n2. `scrabble_score(word)` - Takes a word and returns its total Scrabble score using the letter values.",
