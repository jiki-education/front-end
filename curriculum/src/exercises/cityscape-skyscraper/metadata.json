Build it from the bottom up:\n1. **Ground floor (y=1)**: wall, glass, entrance, glass, wall\n2. **Upper floors**: wall, glass, glass, glass, wall (use `num_floors() - 1` to know how many)\n3. **Roof (top row)**: wall, wall, wall, wall, wall\n\nUse a variable and a repeat loop for the upper floors!",
