  "instructions": "In this exercise, you build a wall from scratch with 55 bricks total.\n\nThe final wall should look like this:\n\n![Completed Wall](https://assets.exercism.org/bootcamp/graphics/completed-wall.png)\n\nThings you need to know:\n\n- **Every** brick is 10 high and 20 wide.\n- The rows alternate between starting at the left edge (5 bricks), and starting off-screen to the left (6 bricks).\n- The `rectangle` function can only appear once in your code!\n\nThe aim of this exercise is for you to experiment with using `repeat` blocks and potentially use `functions`. There are many different ways to solve this exercise. Your challenge is to solve it in a way that results in clean, satisfying code.\n\n### Functions\n\nYou need one function for this exercise:\n\n- `rectangle(left, top, width, height, color)`: Draws a rectangle with the given color.",

    "Use nested loops: outer loop for rows, inner loop for bricks in each row",
    "Odd rows (0, 2, 4...) start at x=0 with 5 bricks",
    "Even rows (1, 3, 5...) start at x=-10 with 6 bricks",
    "Use modulo (%) to check if a row number is odd or even",
    "Each brick is 20 wide and 10 tall"
