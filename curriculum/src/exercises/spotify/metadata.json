  "instructions": "In this exercise, you'll parse data from a mock Spotify API.\n\nThe API requires two types of requests:\n\n1. **User request**: Fetch a user's favorite tracks from `https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{username}`. This returns a dictionary with an `items` list, where each item has a `urls` dictionary containing a `spotify_api` URL.\n\n2. **Artist request**: Fetch artist details from the URL in the previous response. This returns a dictionary with a `name` key.\n\nCreate a function called `favoriteArtists` that takes a username and returns a sentence like:\n\n```\n\"fred's most listened to artists are: Glee, NSYNC, Beethoven, and Limp Bizkit!\"\n```\n\nIf there is an error from the API, return the error prefixed with `\"Error: \"`.\n\nThe `fetch(url, params)` function is provided. For this exercise, params should always be an empty dictionary `{}`.",

  "hints": [
    "Start by using fetch() with the user endpoint URL, built by concatenating the base URL with the username",
    "Check if the response has an error key using hasKey() before processing items",
    "Loop through the items to extract artist API URLs, then fetch each one to get the artist name",
    "Build the sentence by joining artist names with commas, using ', and ' before the last one"
