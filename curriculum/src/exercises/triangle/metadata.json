  "instructions": "Your task is to create a function that checks whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.\n\n### Triangles\n\n- An _equilateral_ triangle has all three sides the same length.\n- An _isosceles_ triangle has two sides the same length.\n- A _scalene_ triangle has all sides of different lengths.\n\nFor a triangle to be valid:\n\n- All sides have to be greater than 0\n- If you add together any two sides, the total must be larger than the third side.\n\n### The function\n\nThe function must be called `determineTriangleType`. It must take three inputs, which will be numbers for the three sides of the triangle. It must return one of `\"invalid\"`, `\"equilateral\"`, `\"isosceles\"` or `\"scalene\"`.",

    "Start by checking if the triangle is invalid - check if any side is zero or if the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third",
    "Check for equilateral first - all three sides must be equal",
    "For isosceles, check if any two sides are equal",
    "If it's not invalid, equilateral, or isosceles, it must be scalene"
