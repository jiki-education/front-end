# You might want to create helper functions first:
# - A function to remove the honorific from a name (everything before the first space)
# - A function to check if a string ends with another string

def on_guest_list(names, person):
    # Remove the honorific from person to get the surname
    # Go through each name in names
    # If the name ends with the surname, return True
    # If none match, return False
    pass
