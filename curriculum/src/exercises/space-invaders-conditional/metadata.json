They're now arranged in two rows, but not every column has an alien.\n\nYou have three functions:\n- `move()` moves your laser cannon one position to the right\n- `shoot()` fires the laser upwards\n- `is_alien_above()` returns `true` if there's an alien above you, or `false` if not\n\nYou need to move across the screen, checking each position. If there's an alien above you, shoot it! If not, just move on.\n\n**Don't shoot when there's no alien above you, or you lose!**",
