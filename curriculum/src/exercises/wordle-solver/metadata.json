  "instructions": "Time to build a Wordle solver! You need to create a `processGame` function that takes no inputs and automatically solves the game.\n\nYou have three functions available:\n- `getTargetWord()`: Returns the secret target word.\n- `commonWords()`: Returns a list of 100+ possible words.\n- `addWord(row, word, states)`: Adds a word to the board at the given row (1-6) with its states.\n\nFor each guess, compare it to the target word to determine the states (correct/present/absent), then add it to the board. Keep guessing until you find the right word or use all 6 slots.\n\nThe best guess is the **first word** in the commonWords list that matches your knowledge so far:\n- Has all 'correct' letters in the right places\n- Has all 'present' letters somewhere (but not in positions you know are wrong)\n- Has no 'absent' letters\n\n**Important:** Don't use getTargetWord() to cheat - only use it for checking your guess to generate states.",

    "Start by always guessing the first word from commonWords()",
    "Build a knowledge dictionary to track what you learn from each guess",
    "Track which letters are absent, which are present, and which positions are correct",
    "For each position, track which letters are definitely NOT there",
    "Filter the word list based on your accumulated knowledge"
