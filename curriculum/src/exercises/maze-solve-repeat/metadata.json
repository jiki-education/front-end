  "instructions": "You've been given a working solution to a maze, but it's very long and repetitive. Your job is to refactor the code using `repeat` loops to make it shorter.\n\nLook for groups of consecutive `move()` calls. Each group can be replaced with a single `repeat` loop.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n```\nmove();\nmove();\nmove();\n```\n\nYou can write:\n```\nrepeat(3) {\n  move();\n}\n```\n\nYour solution must be **22 lines of code or fewer**.",

    "Look for groups of consecutive move() calls",
    "Each group of N consecutive move() calls can become a repeat(N) { move(); } block",
    "Count how many move() calls are in each group to get the repeat count",
    "The turn functions should stay outside the repeat blocks",
    "A repeat block is only shorter when the group has 3 or more calls"
