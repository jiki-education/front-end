  "instructions": "Create a bouncing rainbow ball that leaves a colorful trail!\n\nA ball bounces around the canvas, changing direction when it hits the edges. As it moves, it draws circles that cycle through rainbow colors.\n\n### How to solve it\n\n- The canvas goes from `0,0` (top-left) to `100,100` (bottom-right).\n- Create variables for the ball's position (`x`, `y`) and its direction (`xDirection`, `yDirection`).\n- Create a variable for `hue` and `hueDirection` to cycle through colors.\n- Use a repeat loop that runs 1000 times.\n- In each iteration:\n  1. Update `x` and `y` by adding the direction values\n  2. Update `hue` by adding `hue_direction`\n  3. Check if the ball has hit an edge and reverse direction with a random speed\n  4. Check if the hue has gone below 0 or above 360 and reverse hue direction\n  5. Draw a circle at the current position with a color from the hue\n\n### Functions used in this exercise\n\n- `circle(x, y, radius, color)` - Draw a circle with center at (x, y) with the given radius and color\n- `hsl(hue, saturation, luminosity)` - Convert HSL values to a hex color string\n- `randomNumber(min, max)` - Get a random integer between min and max (inclusive)",

  "hints": [
    "You need variables for position (x, y), direction (xDirection, yDirection), hue, and hueDirection",
    "Update x, y, and hue at the start of each loop iteration by adding the direction values",
    "When x goes below 0 or above 100, change xDirection to a random value in the opposite direction",
    "Use randomNumber(1, 5) for positive directions and randomNumber(-5, -1) for negative directions",
    "When hue goes below 0, set hueDirection to 1; when above 360, set it to -1"
