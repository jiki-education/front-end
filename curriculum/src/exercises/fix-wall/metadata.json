  "instructions": "This exercise introduces you to the `rectangle` function.\n\n### Drawing Rectangles\n\nTo draw rectangles, we use the `rectangle` function with 5 inputs:\n\n- `left`: The left side of the rectangle\n- `top`: The top of the rectangle\n- `width`: How wide the rectangle is\n- `height`: How high the rectangle is\n- `color`: The color of the rectangle (a hex string like `\"#ff0000\"`)\n\n## Instructions\n\nYour job is to use three brick-colored rectangles to fill the holes in the wall.\n\nYou can check [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/brick-red/) to find a good hex code for the color of the bricks. Remember to input it as a string.\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check where something needs to go.\n\nTo make your life easier, the top, left, height and widths are all divisible by 10.",

    "The color is the last argument to rectangle",
    "Use a brick-like color such as #AA4A44",
