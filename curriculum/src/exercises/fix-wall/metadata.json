  "instructions": "This exercise introduces you to the `rectangle` and `fill_color_hex` functions.\n\n### Drawing Rectangles\n\nTo draw rectangles, we use the `rectangle` function with 4 inputs:\n\n- `left`: The left side of the rectangle\n- `top`: The top of the rectangle\n- `width`: How wide the rectangle is\n- `height`: How high the rectangle is\n\n### Changing colors\n\nYou can use the `fill_color_hex(color)` function to set the color of something. The input is always a string and can either be a hex color (e.g. `\"#ff0000\"`) or an HTML Color (e.g. `\"red\"`).\n\nYou need to use that function every time you want to **change** the color, before you draw the shape.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYour job is to use three brick-colored rectangles to fill the holes in the wall.\n\nYou can check [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/brick-red/) to find a good hex code for the color of the bricks. Remember to input it as a string.\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check where something needs to go.\n\nTo make your life easier, the top, left, height and widths are all divisible by 10.",

    "Set the fill color before drawing rectangles",
    "Use a brick-like color such as #AA4A44",
