  "instructions": "DNA is a long chain of other chemicals and the most important are the four nucleotides, adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. A single DNA chain can contain billions of these four nucleotides and the order in which they occur is important! We call the order of these nucleotides in a bit of DNA a \"DNA sequence\".\n\nWe represent a DNA sequence as an ordered collection of these four nucleotides and a common way to do that is with a string of characters such as \"ATTACG\" for a DNA sequence of 6 nucleotides. 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' for thymine.\n\nCreate a function called `countNucleotides` that takes a DNA strand, and outputs a dictionary whose keys are the DNA letters, and the values are the amount of times those appear.\n\nIf the strand contains any invalid characters, return `false`.\n\nFor example:\n- `countNucleotides(\"GATTACA\")` returns `{ \"A\": 3, \"C\": 1, \"G\": 1, \"T\": 2 }`\n- `countNucleotides(\"INVALID\")` returns `false`",
