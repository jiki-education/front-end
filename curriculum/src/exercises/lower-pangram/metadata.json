  "instructions": "A pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once.\n\nIn this exercise, you only need to handle lowercase letters. The input will only contain lowercase letters and other characters like spaces, numbers, or punctuation — no uppercase letters.\n\nYour task is to write two functions:\n\n1. `includes(str, target)` — takes a string and a single character, and returns `true` if the character appears in the string, or `false` if it doesn't.\n\n2. `isPangram(sentence)` — takes a sentence and returns `true` if it contains every letter from a to z at least once, or `false` otherwise. This function should use your `includes` function.\n\nThe best known English pangram is: \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"",

    "Write the includes function first — it checks if one character exists in a string",
    "Iterate through each character in the string to check for a match",
    "For isPangram, iterate through each letter of the alphabet",
    "Return false as soon as you find a missing letter"
