The bottom-right is `100,100`.\n- The variables and background are already provided for you.\n- You need to draw three circles for the lights using the variables.\n- The red light goes at the top, yellow in the middle, and green at the bottom.\n\n### Variables provided\n\n- `radius` — the radius of each light\n- `centerX` — the horizontal center of all three lights\n- `topY` — the vertical center of the top (red) light\n- `middleY` — the vertical center of the middle (yellow) light\n- `bottomY` — the vertical center of the bottom (green) light\n\n### Functions used in this exercise\n\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)` — Draw a rectangle\n- `circle(x, y, radius, color)` — Draw a circle",
