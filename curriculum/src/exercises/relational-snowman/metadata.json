  "instructions": "Your task is to rewrite the snowman so all the sizes and positions are derived from a single `size` variable using arithmetic.\n\n<!-- TODO: Add target relational snowman image here -->\n\n### How it works\n\n- The top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`.\n- Three variables are fixed: `size`, `snowmanX`, and `headY`.\n- You need to derive all other variables using arithmetic expressions.\n- The head radius is `size * 2`, the body radius is `size * 3`, and the base radius is `size * 4`.\n- The circles should touch each other: the body sits directly below the head, and the base sits directly below the body.\n- To make two circles touch, the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.\n\n### Variables\n\n- `size` — the base unit (fixed at 5)\n- `snowmanX` — horizontal center (fixed at 50)\n- `headY` — vertical center of the head (fixed at 20)\n- `headRadius` — derive from `size`\n- `bodyRadius` — derive from `size`\n- `baseRadius` — derive from `size`\n- `bodyY` — derive from `headY`, `headRadius`, and `bodyRadius`\n- `baseY` — derive from `bodyY`, `bodyRadius`, and `baseRadius`\n\n### Functions used in this exercise\n\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)` — Draw a rectangle\n- `circle(x, y, radius, color)` — Draw a circle",
