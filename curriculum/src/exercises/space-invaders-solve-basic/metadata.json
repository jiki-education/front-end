Your job is to shoot down all the aliens.\n\nYou have two functions:\n- `move()` moves your laser cannon one position to the right\n- `shoot()` fires the laser upwards\n\nLook at where the aliens are, then write a sequence of `move()` and `shoot()` calls to destroy them all.\n\nBe careful:\n- If you shoot when there's no alien above you, you lose!\n- If you move off the right edge of the screen, you lose!",
