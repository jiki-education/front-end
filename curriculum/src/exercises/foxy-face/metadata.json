  "instructions": "This exercise introduces you to the `triangle` function.\n\n### Drawing Triangles\n\nTo draw triangles, we use the `triangle` function with 7 inputs:\n\n- `x1`, `y1`: The first corner point\n- `x2`, `y2`: The second corner point\n- `x3`, `y3`: The third corner point\n- `color`: The color of the triangle (a hex string like `\"#FF8A14\"`)\n\nEach pair of coordinates defines one of the three corners of the triangle.\n\n## Instructions\n\nYour job is to build a geometric fox face using triangles! We've provided the grey background for you.\n\nYou'll need to draw 8 triangles to create:\n- Two white cheeks\n- Two orange ears\n- Two orange face halves\n- A dark nose (two triangles)\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check coordinates.\n\nHint: Build the fox from back to front. Start with the cheeks, then the ears, then the face, and finally the nose on top.",
