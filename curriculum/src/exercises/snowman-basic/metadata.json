The snowman has:\n\n- A large **base** circle at the bottom\n- A medium **body** circle in the middle\n- A small **head** circle at the top\n\nAll three circles should be centered horizontally on the canvas. Use the target image as a guide.\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check coordinates.\n\nTo make your life easier, all coordinates and sizes are whole numbers.",
