  "instructions": "Create a function called askLlm that takes one input - the question to ask.\n\nUse the fetch(url, parameters) function to hit the API at \"https://myllm.com/api/v2/qanda\". The parameters should be a dictionary with one key/value pair for \"question\".\n\nExplore the data you get back then transform it into the following format:\n\n\"The answer to 'Who won the 1966 Football Men's World Cup?' is 'England' (100% certainty in 0.5s).\"\n\nFinally, return that string.\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n- You will receive multiple possible answers. Choose the one that the LLM has the highest certainty about.\n- 0.78 as a decimal is the same as 78% as a percentage.\n- 123ms is the same as 0.123s (there are 1000 milliseconds in a second).",
