  "instructions": "In the previous exercise, you got the ball bouncing around the game area. Now it's time to add some blocks!\n\nYou have a new `Block` class. When you create an instance using `new Block(left, top)`, you specify its left and top position. All blocks are `16` wide.\n\nThe block has `top`, `left`, `width` and `height` properties which you can read. It also has a `smashed` property you can read and write.\n\nYou have two jobs:\n\n1. Create 5 blocks. They should all have a top of `31`. The first should have a left of `8`, and then they should be evenly distributed along the game area (with a gap of `1` between them).\n\n2. Handle what happens when the ball hits a block. When this happens, set the block's `smashed` property to `true` (which makes it disappear) and reverse the ball's direction. Once all blocks are smashed, stop moving the ball.\n\nFor this exercise, the ball will only ever hit the bottom of a block, which simplifies the collision logic.",

    "Create blocks in a loop: `for (let x = 1; x <= 5; x++) { ... }`",
    "Each block's left position is `8 + ((x - 1) * 17)` — that's 16 width plus 1 gap",
    "To detect a collision, check if the ball's top edge equals the block's bottom edge (`block.top + block.height`)",
    "Also check that the ball is horizontally aligned with the block",
    "Use `continue` to skip blocks that are already smashed",
    "Write a function to check if all blocks are smashed, and use `break` to exit the loop when they are"
