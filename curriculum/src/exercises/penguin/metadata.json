The bottom-right is `100,100`. The penguin is sitting in the middle.\n\nWe've drawn the left hand side for you, and added `TODO` comments for each of the things you need to do.\n\nYou'll need to think about setting the right colors before drawing things.\n\nFor the nose, you should **change** the middle coordinates of the triangle. Don't add a new triangle.\n\nThe functions used in this exercise are:\n\n- `circle(center_x, center_y, radius)`\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height)`\n- `ellipse(center_x, center_y, radius_x, radius_y)`\n- `triangle(x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3)`\n- `fill_color_hex(hex)`",

    "Start by looking at the left wing and create a matching right wing",
    "Remember to set the fill color before drawing each shape",
    "The canvas coordinates go from (0,0) at top-left to (100,100) at bottom-right",
    "For symmetry, if the left wing is at x=28, the right wing should be at x=72 (both 22 units from center at x=50)"
