The bottom-right is `100,100`. The penguin is sitting in the middle.\n\nWe've drawn the left hand side for you, and added `TODO` comments for each of the things you need to do.\n\nEach shape function takes a color as its last argument.\n\nFor the nose, you should **change** the middle coordinates of the triangle. Don't add a new triangle.\n\nThe functions used in this exercise are:\n\n- `circle(centerX, centerY, radius, color)`\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)`\n- `ellipse(centerX, centerY, radiusX, radiusY, color)`\n- `triangle(x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3, color)`",

    "Start by looking at the left wing and create a matching right wing",
    "Remember each shape function takes a color as its last argument",
    "The canvas coordinates go from (0,0) at top-left to (100,100) at bottom-right",
    "For symmetry, if the left wing is at x=28, the right wing should be at x=72 (both 22 units from center at x=50)"
