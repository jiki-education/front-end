# Plant the Flowers
# The gardener wants 9 flowers planted in a row across the garden.
# The first flower should be at position 10, and each flower
# should be 10 pixels apart from the next.
#
# You have a plant() function that takes a position as input.
# For example: plant(10) plants a flower at position 10.
#
# Use a variable to track your position, and a repeat loop
# to plant all 9 flowers without writing plant() 9 times!

# TODO: Create a variable to track your position (start at 10)

# TODO: Use a repeat loop to plant 9 flowers
# Inside the loop:
#   - Plant a flower at the current position
#   - Update the position for the next flower
