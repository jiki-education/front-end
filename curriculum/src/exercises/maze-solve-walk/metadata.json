  "instructions": "In the last exercise you used `move()` to move one step at a time. That works, but it means writing `move()` many times in a row!\n\nIn this exercise, we've replaced `move()` with a new function called `walk()`. This function takes a number as its input and moves forward that many steps.\n\nFor example, `walk(3)` moves forward 3 steps, and `walk(1)` moves forward just 1 step.\n\nUse `walk()`, `turnLeft()`, and `turnRight()` to navigate through the maze and reach the green target cell.",
