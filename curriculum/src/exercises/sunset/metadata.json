  "instructions": "Your task is to animate a sunset scene that lasts 100 iterations.\n\nWe've drawn the initial scene for you. You need to animate a few things:\n\n- **The size of the sun**: It should start with a radius of 5 and grow by 0.2 each iteration.\n- **The position of the sun**: It has an initial center of (50, 10), and should lower in the sky by 1 each iteration.\n- **The color of the sun**: Animate from yellow to orange using RGB.\n- **The color of the sky**: Use HSL to animate the sky color.\n\nRemember to `set` the initial values **outside** of the `repeat` block, and then `change` them **inside** the block **before** you call the drawing functions.\n\n### Functions used in this exercise:\n\n- `circle(center_x, center_y, radius, color)` - Draw a circle\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)` - Draw a rectangle\n- `rgb_to_hex(red, green, blue)` - Convert RGB values (0-255) to a hex color string\n- `hsl_to_hex(hue, saturation, luminosity)` - Convert HSL values to a hex color string",

    "Set variables for the sun's position, radius, and color components BEFORE the repeat block",
    "Change each variable INSIDE the repeat block, BEFORE drawing the shapes",
    "For RGB colors: red is 0-255, green is 0-255, blue is 0-255",
    "For HSL colors: hue is 0-360, saturation is 0-100, luminosity is 0-100",
    "Draw the sky rectangle first, then the sun circle, then the sea and sand"
