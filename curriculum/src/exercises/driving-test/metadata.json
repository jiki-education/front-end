  "instructions": "When you take your driving test in the UK, you get graded on a variety of different areas like observations, technical skills, parking, etc.\n\nYou're allowed to make a few small mistakes (\"minors\") but not any big ones (\"majors\"). If you make one major, or 5 or more minors, you fail. Otherwise, they send you out on the road!\n\nIn your spare time, you administer these Driving Tests. As the student drives, you make notes on each area:\n- If they make a minor mistake, you add a ❌ to the chart\n- If they make a major mistake, you add a 💥\n- If they pass that area without issue, you put down a ✅\n\nWrite a function called `didTheyPass` that expects a string containing the pass (✅), minor (❌) and major (💥) symbols as input. It should determine if they pass or not, returning `true` if they do, and `false` if they don't.",
