  "instructions": "ISBNs are 10 digit numbers given to uniquely identify books. Each one is unique and follows a specific format. They also have a verification process to check they're real ISBNs.\n\nISBNs normally contain dashes and look like: `3-598-21508-8`\n\n(There are also 13 digit ISBNs, but you can safely ignore those for this exercise!)\n\n### Verifying an ISBN\n\nTo verify an ISBN, we:\n\n- Start at the left and add together each digit multiplied by a weight counting down from 10 to 1.\n- Get the remainder of that total divided by 11.\n- Check whether that remainder is zero.\n\nFor example, for the ISBN `3-598-21508-8`, we would check whether:\n\n```\n(3*10 + 5*9 + 9*8 + 8*7 + 2*6 + 1*5 + 5*4 + 0*3 + 8*2 + 8*1) % 11 == 0\n```\n\nSince the result is 0, this proves that our ISBN is valid.\n\nA couple more important notes:\n\n- Sometimes an ISBN can end with an X. If that's the case, it represents `10`. If the X appears anywhere else, the ISBN is invalid.\n- ISBNs may be written with or without hyphens.\n- Any other characters make the ISBN invalid.\n\nCreate a function called `is_valid_isbn` that takes an ISBN string and returns `true` if it is valid and `false` if it is not.",

    "Iterate through each character in the ISBN string",
    "Skip dashes - they don't affect the calculation",
    "Use a multiplier that starts at 10 and decreases by 1 for each digit",
    "Handle 'X' specially - it represents 10 and is only valid as the last digit",
    "After processing all characters, check that the multiplier is 0 (meaning exactly 10 digits were found)",
    "The ISBN is valid if the total sum is divisible by 11"
