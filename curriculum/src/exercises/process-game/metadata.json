  "instructions": "Now that you can process a single guess, it's time to process a whole game!\n\nCreate a function called `processGame` that takes two inputs:\n1. The secret target word.\n2. A list of guesses the player has made.\n\nYou should work out the state of each row then call the `colorRow(row, states)` function with the row number (`1-6`) and a list of states for each letter.\n\nFor example, if the first guess was correct:\n```\ncolorRow(1, [\"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\"])\n```",
