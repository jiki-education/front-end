  "instructions": "Tonight's party is very exclusive - only people whose names start with a specific set of letters are allowed in!\n\nYou have these functions:\n- `ask_name()` returns the name of the person at the door\n- `get_allowed_start()` returns the required starting letters for tonight's party\n- `let_in()` lets the person into the party\n- `turn_away()` turns the person away\n\nFor example, if tonight's allowed start is `\"S\"`, then `\"Sarah\"` gets in but `\"Brad\"` doesn't. If the allowed start is `\"Brad\"`, then `\"Bradley\"` gets in but `\"Brian\"` doesn't.\n\nWrite code that checks if the person's name starts with the allowed letters, and either lets them in or turns them away.",

    "Start by getting the name and the allowed start using the provided functions",
    "Think about how to check each character of the allowed start against the corresponding character in the name",
    "What happens if the allowed start is longer than the person's name? You'll need to handle that edge case",
    "You'll need to calculate the lengths of both words. Think back to what you did in Sign Painter Price.",
    "Use a counter variable to track which position you're comparing"
