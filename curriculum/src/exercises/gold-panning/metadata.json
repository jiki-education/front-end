  "instructions": "You're panning for gold in a river! Each time you dip your pan, you find a random number of gold nuggets.\n\nYou have two functions:\n- `pan()` dips your pan in the river and **gives back** the number of nuggets you found\n- `sell(nuggets)` sells your nuggets at the trading post\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n1. Start with 0 nuggets\n2. Pan 5 times, adding each result to your running total\n3. Sell all your nuggets at the trading post\n\n**Important:** Each time you call `pan()`, it gives back a different number. You need to add each result to your total as you go. Use a loop to pan 5 times and keep a running total of your nuggets.",
