def find_anagrams(target, possibilities):
    # Your code here
    # 1. Convert the target to lowercase and sort its letters
    # 2. Create an empty results list
    # 3. Loop through each possibility
    # 4. For each possibility:
    #    - Convert to lowercase
    #    - Skip if it's the same word as the target (case-insensitive)
    #    - Sort the letters
    #    - If the sorted letters match the target's sorted letters, add to results
    # 5. Sort the results alphabetically and return them
    pass
