Your job is to check someone's age and decide whether to open the door.\n\nYou have two functions:\n- `getAge()` returns the age of the person waiting outside\n- `openDoor()` opens the door to let them in\n\nThe venue's policy is that only people **over 20** (not including 20) are allowed in. Get the person's age, and if they're old enough, open the door!",
