def extract_words(sentence):
    # Your code here
    # 1. Create an empty list and an empty string for building words
    # 2. Loop through each character in the sentence
    # 3. If it's a space, append the current word (if not empty) and reset
    # 4. If it's a period, skip it
    # 5. Otherwise, add the character to the current word
    # 6. Don't forget to append the last word after the loop
    pass
