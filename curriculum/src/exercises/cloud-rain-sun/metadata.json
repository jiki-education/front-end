  "instructions": "This exercise combines the `rectangle`, `circle`, and `ellipse` functions to create a weather scene.\n\n### Drawing Ellipses\n\nTo draw ellipses, we use the `ellipse` function with 5 inputs:\n\n- `x`: The x position of the center\n- `y`: The y position of the center\n- `rx`: The horizontal radius (how wide)\n- `ry`: The vertical radius (how tall)\n- `color`: The color (a hex string)\n\nAn ellipse is like a stretched circle. When `rx` and `ry` are different, you get an oval shape.\n\n### Quick Reminder\n\n- `rectangle(left, top, width, height, color)` — draws a rectangle\n- `circle(x, y, radius, color)` — draws a circle\n- `ellipse(x, y, rx, ry, color)` — draws an ellipse\n\n## Instructions\n\nCreate a weather scene with a light blue sky, a sun, a cloud, and some rain drops.\n\nWe've given you the main body of the cloud (a white rectangle). You need to add:\n1. A light blue background\n2. A yellow sun\n3. Circles to round out the cloud\n4. Ellipse-shaped rain drops\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`.",

    "Start with the background rectangle covering the whole canvas: (0, 0, 100, 100)",
    "The cloud is built from one rectangle and four circles along its edges",
    "The sun is a yellow circle at (75, 30) with radius 15",
    "Rain drops are ellipses — taller than wide (rx=3, ry=5)"
