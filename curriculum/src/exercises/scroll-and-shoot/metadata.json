  "instructions": "Welcome to the first Space Invaders exercise. This is a classic 1970s game, and one of the first I ever played!\n\nBy the end of the Bootcamp you'll have built this from scratch. But for now, your job is to play and win the game, by shooting down all the aliens.\n\nYou can move the laser left and right using the `move_left()` and `move_right()` functions. You can experiment to see how far left and right you can move. If you go off the edge of the screen, you lose.\n\nAs you move, you need to check whether there's an alien above you using the `is_alien_above()` function and then `shoot()` it if so. If you shoot when there's not an alien, you'll lose the game - wasting ammo is not allowed!\n\nThe laser canon easily overheats. You need to move between shoots to keep it cool.\n\nOnce all the aliens have been shot down, you win!",

    "Break the exercise down into steps - get the laser moving from side to side first",
    "Track your position with a variable so you know where you are",
    "Keep track of which direction you're moving (left or right)",
    "Use boundaries to know when to turn around",
    "Check for aliens above before shooting",
    "The logic is similar to the rainbow ball exercise - you need to bounce back and forth"
