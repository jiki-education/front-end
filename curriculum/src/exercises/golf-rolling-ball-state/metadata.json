  "instructions": "A golf ball is sitting on the course. Your job is to roll it into the hole!\n\nYou have one function:\n- `roll_to(x)` rolls the ball to position `x`\n\nThe ball starts at position **28** and needs to reach position **88**. You'll need to track the ball's position in a variable and update it in a loop.\n\nYour solution should use a variable to track `x` and a repeat loop to roll the ball one step at a time.",
