  "instructions": "One evening, you stumbled upon an old notebook filled with cryptic scribbles, as though someone had been obsessively chasing an idea. On one page, a single question stood out: **Can every number find its way to 1?** It was tied to something called the **Collatz Conjecture**, a puzzle that has baffled thinkers for decades.\n\nThe rules are deceptively simple:\n\n1. Choose a number.\n2. If it's even, divide it by 2.\n3. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and then add 1.\n4. Repeat with the result, continuing indefinitely.\n\nFor example, starting with 12:\n\n```\n12 → 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1\n```\n\nCounting from the second number (6), it took 9 steps to reach 1.\n\nCreate a function called `collatz_steps` that takes one input, a number. Return **how many steps** it takes to get from any given number to 1, following the rules of the Collatz Conjecture.",

  "hints": [
    "Use a loop that keeps running until the number reaches 1",
    "Check if a number is even using the modulo operator: number % 2 == 0",
    "Keep a counter variable to track the number of steps",
    "Return the counter when the number reaches 1"
