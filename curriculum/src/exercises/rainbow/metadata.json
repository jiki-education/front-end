  "instructions": "Your task is to make a beautiful rainbow pattern made up of 100 vertical bars.\n\n### How to solve it\n\n- The top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`.\n- The rainbow is made up of `100` bars, each with a width of `1`, starting at the top (`0`) and being `100` high.\n- The first bar should have an `x` of 1, and the final bar should have an `x` of 100.\n- You will need a variable for `x`. When choosing its initial value, remember that it will be increased in the `repeat` block BEFORE drawing.\n- You also need a variable for the `hue` of the color (set initially to `0`).\n- You need to write a repeat loop that repeats 100 times.\n- In each iteration of the repeat loop you need to increase `x` by 1 and increase the hue by `3`.\n- You then need to use the `fill_color_hsl` (with saturation and luminance set around 50), and `rectangle` functions to draw.\n\n### Functions used in this exercise\n\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height)` - Draw a rectangle\n- `fill_color_hsl(hue, saturation, luminance)` - Set fill color using HSL values",

    "Set x to 0 initially so that after adding 1 the first bar is at x=1",
    "Set hue to 0 initially",
    "In the loop: first change the variables, then set the color, then draw",
    "Use saturation and luminance of 50 for nice colors",
    "Each rectangle should be 1 wide and 100 tall"
