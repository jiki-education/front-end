  "instructions": "You run a sign-making shop. You charge $12 per letter for every sign you make. Spaces are free -- they don't cost anything.\n\nWrite a function called `sign_price` that takes the text for a sign and returns a formatted message with the total price.\n\nTo count the letters, loop through each character and skip any spaces. Multiply the count by 12 to get the price. Then return a string in the format `\"That will cost $X\"` where X is the price.\n\nExamples:\n- `sign_price(\"Hello\")` returns `\"That will cost $60\"` (5 letters)\n- `sign_price(\"Hi There\")` returns `\"That will cost $84\"` (7 letters, space skipped)\n- `sign_price(\"A\")` returns `\"That will cost $12\"` (1 letter)",
