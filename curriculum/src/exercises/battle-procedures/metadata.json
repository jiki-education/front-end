It worked, but the shooting logic was mixed in with everything else.\n\nIn this exercise, you'll extract the shooting logic into its own function called `shootIfAlienAbove`. This function should check if there's an alien above the laser cannon and shoot it if so.\n\nThe rest of the game logic (tracking position, changing direction at boundaries, moving the laser) stays in the loop as before.\n\nCreate your `shootIfAlienAbove` function, then use it inside the loop alongside the movement logic.",
