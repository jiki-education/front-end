Given a number, create a list of strings where each string contains an increasing number of stars.\n\nFor example, given the number 3, you should return:\n\n```\n[\"*\", \"**\", \"***\"]\n```\n\nThe first element has 1 star, the second has 2 stars, and so on up to the given count.\n\nIf the count is 0, return an empty list.\n\nCreate a function called `stars` that takes one input, a count, and returns the list of star strings.",
