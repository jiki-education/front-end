  "instructions": "You work for a company that sells fonts through their website. They'd like to show a different sentence each time someone views a font on their website. To give a comprehensive sense of the font, the random sentences should use all the letters in the English alphabet.\n\nA pangram is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if a letter is lower-case (e.g. 'k') or upper-case (e.g. 'K').\n\nCreate a function called `is_pangram` that takes a sentence as a string, and returns a boolean representing whether it is, or is not, a pangram.\n\nThe best known English pangram is: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"",

    "Consider writing helper functions like contains(), index_of(), and to_lower()",
    "Convert the sentence to lowercase first to make comparison easier",
    "Check if each letter of the alphabet appears in the sentence",
    "Return false as soon as you find a missing letter"
