  "instructions": "You've just invested $10 in the stock market! Each year, the market randomly grows your money by between 0% and 10%.\n\nHere's the key: the growth each year is based on your **current** balance, not your original $10. So as your money grows, the growth itself gets bigger too.\n\nTo work out each year's growth:\n1. Pick a random rate from 0 to 10 using `Math.randomInt(0, 10)`\n2. Work out the growth amount: take your current balance, multiply it by the rate, then divide by 100\n3. Add that growth to your balance\n\nFor example, if your balance is $11 and the rate is 5, the growth would be 11 times 5 divided by 100 = $0.55, making your new balance $11.55.\n\nDo this for 20 years, then call `checkBalance()` with your final amount.",
