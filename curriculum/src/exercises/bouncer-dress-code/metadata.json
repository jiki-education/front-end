As the bouncer, you need to check what the person is wearing and decide what to do.\n\nYou have these functions:\n- `get_outfit()` returns the name of the outfit the person is wearing (e.g. `\"ballgown\"`, `\"suit\"`, `\"jeans\"`)\n- `offer_champagne()` offers the person a glass of champagne\n- `let_in()` lets the person into the venue\n- `turn_away()` turns the person away\n\nThe dress code rules:\n- **Fancy** (`\"ballgown\"` or `\"tuxedo\"`): Offer champagne AND let them in\n- **Smart** (`\"suit\"` or `\"dress\"`): Let them in\n- **Anything else**: Turn them away",
