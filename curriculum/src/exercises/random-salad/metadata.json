  "instructions": "You and your partner can never agree on salad proportions — you want loads of leaves, they want extra croutons, neither of you can compromise. You've decided to let randomness settle it once and for all!\n\nUse `Math.randomInt(min, max)` to generate a random amount of each ingredient, then make the salad.\n\n`Math.randomInt(min, max)` gives back a random whole number between `min` and `max` (inclusive). For example, `Math.randomInt(1, 6)` gives back a number from 1 to 6, like rolling a die.\n\nThe ingredients and their ranges are:\n- **Leaves**: between 20 and 100\n- **Tomatoes**: between 5 and 20\n- **Croutons**: between 10 and 50\n- **Dressing**: between 1 and 10 spoonfuls\n\nGenerate a random value for each ingredient, store each in a variable, then call `makeSalad()` with all four values.",

    "Use Math.randomInt(20, 100) for the leaves and store the result in a variable",
    "Each ingredient needs its own Math.randomInt() call with the right range",
    "Pass all four variables to makeSalad() in order: leaves, tomatoes, croutons, dressing"
