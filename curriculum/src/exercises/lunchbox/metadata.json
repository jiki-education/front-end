However, sometimes you get a milkshake, which is too big to go in the lunchbox, so you carry it instead, and just put the sandwich and the snack in.\n\nWrite a function called `packALunch` that takes three inputs: `sandwich`, `drink`, and `snack` (all strings). It should return a list of the items packed into the lunchbox.\n\nYou must create only one list and use `push` to add items to it.",
