  "instructions": "Welcome to Wordle! The game works like this: there is a correct secret word, and you have 6 guesses to get it right. For each guess, if a letter is correct it goes green, if a letter is present in the word but in the wrong place it goes yellow, and if a letter is missing it goes grey.\n\nYour job is to create a function called `processGuess` that takes two inputs: the secret target word, and the guess the player has made. You should work out the state of each letter then call the `colorRow(1, states)` function with a list of states for each letter: either `\"correct\"`, `\"present\"`, or `\"absent\"`.\n\nFor example, if the guess was correct, you would call:\n```\ncolorRow(1, [\"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\", \"correct\"])\n```\n\nYou also have access to the `push(list, element)` function which adds an element to a list and returns the new list.",

    "Iterate through each letter of the guess with a loop that tracks position",
    "Compare each letter to the same position in the target word for 'correct'",
    "Check if the letter exists anywhere in the word for 'present'",
    "Use push() to build up the states list",
    "A helper function to check if a letter is contained in a word is very useful"
