  "instructions": "To start our game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, we're going to write some code to determine the winner.\n\nIn Rock, Paper, Scissors, two players each choose rock, paper or scissors. You then compare the choices to see who's won:\n\n- If both players choose the same, it's a tie.\n- Rock blunts scissors (rock wins).\n- Scissors cut paper (scissors wins).\n- Paper smothers rock (paper wins).\n\nYour job is to compare the choices the players have made and announce the winner to the playing hall.\n\n### Functions\n\nYou have three functions to use:\n\n- `getPlayer1Choice()`: Returns player 1's choice - one of `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"` or `\"scissors\"`.\n- `getPlayer2Choice()`: Returns player 2's choice. Also `\"rock\"`, `\"paper\"` or `\"scissors\"`.\n- `announceResult(result)`: You announce the result, using one of `\"player_1\"`, `\"player_2\"`, or `\"tie\"` as an input.",

    "Start by getting both players' choices and storing them in variables",
    "Check if the choices are equal first — that's always a tie",
    "Use `and` to combine two conditions, e.g. player 1 chose rock AND player 2 chose scissors",
    "You can default the result to one value, then only check for the other cases"
