  "instructions": "Raindrops is a version of the classic FizzBuzz challenge that's been used in programming interviews forever.\n\nYour task is to convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds.\n\nWe do this by seeing what the number is divisible by (e.g. the number 10 is divisible by 1, 2, 5 and 10. The number 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12).\n\nIf a given number:\n\n- is divisible by 3, add \"Pling\" to the result.\n- is divisible by 5, add \"Plang\" to the result.\n- is divisible by 7, add \"Plong\" to the result.\n- is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7, the result should be the number as a string.\n\nYou need to create a function called `raindrops` that takes the number as an input and returns its Raindrops sounds.\n\nTo solve this, you have two helpful functions:\n\n- `concatenate(str1, str2, ...)`: Takes 2 or more strings and returns them combined into one.\n- `number_to_string(number)`: Takes a number as an input and returns it as a string.\n\n### Examples\n\n- `raindrops(28)` returns \"Plong\" because 28 is divisible by 7, but not 3 or 5.\n- `raindrops(30)` returns \"PlingPlang\" because 30 is divisible by 3 and 5, but not 7.\n- `raindrops(34)` returns \"34\" because 34 is not divisible by 3, 5, or 7.",

    "The key is to accumulate the sounds as you work through the if statements - don't return straight away",
    "Start with an empty string and build up the result",
    "Use concatenate() to add each sound to the result",
    "If the result is still empty after checking all three divisors, convert the number to a string",
    "This exercise should only have one or two return statements"
