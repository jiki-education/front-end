  "instructions": "You're building an automated Scrabble bot. The bot has a rack of letter tiles represented as a string (e.g. `\"AERHBT\"`). When the bot decides which letter to play, it needs to know which position to move its hand to in order to pick up the tile.\n\nWrite a function called `find_tile` that takes the rack (a string of letters) and the letter to find. It should return the position of the first matching tile (starting from 0). If the tile isn't in the rack, return `-1`.\n\nExamples:\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"A\")` returns `0`\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"C\")` returns `2`\n- `find_tile(\"BANANA\", \"A\")` returns `1` (the first A)\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"Z\")` returns `-1`",

    "You'll need a variable to track your current position as you look through the rack",
    "Use a for-each loop to look at each tile one by one",
    "If the current tile matches the letter, return the current position immediately",
    "Don't forget to increase your position counter after each tile",
    "If you get through the whole rack without finding the letter, return -1"
