  "title": "Tile Rack",
  "instructions": "You're building an automated Scrabble bot. The bot has a rack of letter tiles represented as a string (e.g. `\"AERHBT\"`). When the bot decides which letter to play, it needs to know which position to move its hand to in order to pick up the tile.\n\nWrite a function called `find_tile` that takes the rack (a string of letters) and the letter to find. If the tile is found, return `\"Move to position X\"` where X is the position of the first matching tile (starting from 0). If the tile isn't in the rack, return `\"Error: Tile not on rack\"`.\n\nTo build the result string, you'll need to convert the position number to a string and concatenate the parts together.\n\nExamples:\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"A\")` returns `\"Move to position 0\"`\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"C\")` returns `\"Move to position 2\"`\n- `find_tile(\"BANANA\", \"A\")` returns `\"Move to position 1\"` (the first A)\n- `find_tile(\"ABCDE\", \"Z\")` returns `\"Error: Tile not on rack\"`",

    "You'll need a variable to track your current position as you look through the rack",
    "Use a for-each loop to look at each tile one by one",
    "If the current tile matches the letter, convert the position to a string and build the result message",
    "Don't forget to increase your position counter after each tile",
    "If you get through the whole rack without finding the letter, return the error message"
