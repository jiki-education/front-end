  "instructions": "Create a city skyline with multiple buildings of random heights!\n\nYou have four functions:\n- `buildWall(x, y)` places a wall block at grid position (x, y)\n- `buildGlass(x, y)` places a glass panel at grid position (x, y)\n- `buildEntrance(x, y)` places an entrance door at grid position (x, y)\n- `numBuildings()` returns how many buildings to construct\n\nEach building is **5 columns wide**. The buildings are placed side by side starting at x=1.\n\nFor each building:\n1. Choose a random number of upper floors (0 to 6)\n2. Build the **ground floor** at y=1: wall, glass, entrance, glass, wall\n3. Build the **upper floors**: wall, glass, glass, glass, wall\n4. Build the **roof**: wall, wall, wall, wall, wall\n5. Move x along by 5 for the next building",
