  "instructions": "Your task is to build a snowman by setting the right variable values so your snowman matches the image.\n\n<!-- TODO: Add target snowman image here -->\n\n### How it works\n\n- The top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`.\n- The code to draw the snowman is already written for you.\n- You need to set the correct values for the **7 variables** at the top of the code.\n- The snowman is made of three white circles (head, body, base) stacked on top of each other.\n- The base is the biggest circle, the body is medium, and the head is the smallest.\n- All three circles share the same `x` position (the snowman is centered).\n\n### Variables to set\n\n- `snowmanX` — the horizontal center of the snowman\n- `headY`, `headRadius` — the vertical center and radius of the head\n- `bodyY`, `bodyRadius` — the vertical center and radius of the body\n- `baseY`, `baseRadius` — the vertical center and radius of the base\n\n### Functions used in this exercise\n\n- `rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)` — Draw a rectangle\n- `circle(x, y, radius, color)` — Draw a circle",
