  "instructions": "You're on the golf course and the golfer has hit the ball. Your job is to move the ball and check if it lands in the hole!\n\nYou have four functions:\n- `move_ball_right()` moves the ball one unit to the right\n- `move_ball_down()` moves the ball one unit down\n- `get_shot_length()` returns how far the golfer hit the ball\n- `fire_fireworks()` celebrates a successful shot\n\nFirst, get the shot length and move the ball that many steps to the right. Then check: if the shot length is between 56 and 63 (inclusive), the ball is over the hole! Move it down 9 units to sink it, then fire the fireworks.\n\nIf the shot doesn't land over the hole, just leave the ball where it stops.",
