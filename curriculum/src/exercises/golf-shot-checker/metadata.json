  "instructions": "You're on the golf course and the golfer has hit the ball. Your job is to roll the ball and check if it lands in the hole!\n\nYou have three functions:\n- `rollTo(x, y)` rolls the ball to position (x, y)\n- `getShotLength()` returns how far the golfer hit the ball\n- `fireFireworks()` celebrates the shot\n\nThe ball starts at x=29, y=75. Get the shot length, then roll the ball right one step at a time (shotLength + 1 steps). If the shot length is between 56 and 65 (inclusive), the ball is over the hole — roll it down 9 units to sink it. Then fire the fireworks!",

    "If the ball is over the hole, roll it down 9 times by updating y"
