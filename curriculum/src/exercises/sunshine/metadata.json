  "instructions": "This exercise introduces you to the `circle` function.\n\n### Drawing Circles\n\nTo draw circles, we use the `circle` function with 4 inputs:\n\n- `x`: The x position of the center of the circle\n- `y`: The y position of the center of the circle\n- `radius`: How big the circle is\n- `color`: The color of the circle (a hex string like `\"#ffed06\"`)\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe've drawn a light blue sky and some sun spikes for you. Don't worry about the triangles yet - we'll cover those separately shortly!\n\nYour job is to draw the sun itself by adding a yellow circle in the center of the canvas.\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check coordinates.",
