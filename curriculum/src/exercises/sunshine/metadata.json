  "instructions": "This exercise introduces you to the `triangle` and `circle` functions.\n\n### Drawing Triangles\n\nTo draw triangles, we use the `triangle` function with 7 inputs:\n\n- `x1`, `y1`: The first corner point\n- `x2`, `y2`: The second corner point\n- `x3`, `y3`: The third corner point\n- `color`: The color of the triangle (a hex string like `\"#ffed06\"`)\n\n### Drawing Circles\n\nTo draw circles, we use the `circle` function with 4 inputs:\n\n- `x`: The x position of the center of the circle\n- `y`: The y position of the center of the circle\n- `radius`: How big the circle is\n- `color`: The color of the circle (a hex string like `\"#ffed06\"`)\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe've drawn a light blue sky for you.\n\nYour job is to draw the sunshine by adding 8 yellow triangle spikes around the canvas and a yellow circle in the center.\n\nThe top-left of the drawing canvas is `0,0`. The bottom-right is `100,100`. You can hover over the canvas to check coordinates.",
