# Coding Style Guidelines

## File Organization

### React/TypeScript Components

Components should be organized from most general to most specific, cascading from top to bottom:

1. **Imports** - At the very top
2. **Types/Interfaces** - Type definitions for the component
3. **Main Component** - The exported component function
4. **Sub-components** - Any sub-components used by the main component
5. **Event Handlers** - Handler functions (handleClick, handleChange, etc.)
6. **Helper Functions** - Utility functions at the bottom

This creates a natural reading flow where the high-level structure (JSX/TSX) is immediately visible, and implementation details are found below.

**Note on Handler Functions**: In components that use the orchestrator pattern or need to pass complex props, handlers can be moved to module level (outside the component) to improve testability and reduce prop complexity. Use your judgment based on whether the handler needs access to component closure.

#### Example Structure

```typescript
// 1. Imports
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { someUtility } from './utils';

// 2. Types/Interfaces
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}

// 3. Main Component (most general - the "what")
export default function MyComponent({ title, onClick }: ComponentProps) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    processData(state);
    onClick();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <SubComponent value={state} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// 4. Sub-components
function SubComponent({ value }: { value: number }) {
  return <span>{formatValue(value)}</span>;
}

// 5. Helper Functions (most specific - the "how")
function processData(data: number): void {
  // Implementation details
}

function formatValue(value: number): string {
  return `Value: ${value}`;
}
```

## Rationale

- **Readability**: Developers can quickly understand what a component does by looking at the JSX structure first
- **Maintenance**: Related logic is grouped together, with implementation details separate from structure
- **Cognitive Load**: Reduces mental overhead by presenting information in order of importance
- **Consistency**: Provides a predictable structure across all components

## Other Style Guidelines

### General TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use `const` for functions and immutable values
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Check TypeScript types with `npx tsc --noEmit` (not `pnpm run build` which can break dev server)

### React Specific

- Use function components with hooks (no class components)
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Keep JSX readable with proper indentation
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code that doesn't need extensive comments
- Add comments only for complex business logic or non-obvious decisions
- Use JSDoc for public APIs and component props when needed

## Global Utilities

### Sound System

The sound system provides a globally accessible `playSound` function for audio feedback:

```typescript
import { playSound } from "@/lib/sound";

// Use directly in event handlers
playSound("success");
playSound("error");
```

- No need to initialize - singleton pattern handles setup
- Sounds are preloaded on first import
- See [sound.md](./sound.md) for full documentation
