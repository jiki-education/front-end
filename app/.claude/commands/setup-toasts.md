I have installed the dependency called react-hot-toast.

Take a look at the library, how it works, check the documentation: https://react-hot-toast.com/docs

Then integrate it into my codebase. I want to be able to call toast.[anything] from anywhere in my codebase.

Best is to probably put <Toaster /> in my root layout file.

Give me a few buttons so I can test it out.
