# Educational Features

JikiScript is designed specifically for educational environments, with features that help students learn programming concepts effectively.

## Progressive Language Learning

### Configurable Syntax

Enables/disables language features allowing progressive learning from variables through control flow to advanced features.

### Learning Progression

Variables & Basic Operations → Control Flow → Functions → Advanced Features

## Visual Learning Tools

### Frame-by-Frame Execution

Timeline scrubbing, step-by-step analysis, variable evolution tracking, and execution flow visualization.

### Execution Descriptions

Plain-language explanations of each code execution step for educational understanding.

## Error Handling & Debugging Support

### Student-Friendly Error Messages

Technical errors translated into learning opportunities with educational explanations.

### Error Prevention

Typo detection, scope guidance, and syntax hints for common mistakes.

### Debugging Tools

Variable inspector, execution trace, and state snapshots for debugging assistance.

## Safety & Constraints

### Execution Limits

Loop iteration limits, execution time limits, and memory controls for safe learning.

### Controlled Environment

Safe standard library with predictable behavior and isolated execution.

## Assessment & Analytics

### Execution Analytics

Tracks student progress, execution patterns, common errors, and debugging behavior.

### Educational Feedback

Code quality metrics, learning objective tracking, and peer comparison support.

## UI Integration

### Jiki Interface

Standardized frame data structure feeding educational UI with location, variables, descriptions, and timeline information.

### Interactive Features

Breakpoints, variable watches, step controls, and speed controls for interactive debugging.

## Multi-Language Support
