You've probably just spotted a **project** and are wondering what it is. Good news — projects are one of the most fun parts of Jiki!

## What are projects?

Projects are **bigger, meatier challenges** that go beyond what you'd typically see in a regular exercise. Where most exercises focus on a specific concept or technique, projects ask you to bring together multiple things you've learned and apply them to build something more substantial.

Think of exercises as practising individual skills, and projects as putting those skills together in a more realistic way. They're designed to **stretch you** a bit — to give you a proper challenge that feels satisfying to work through.

## How do they unlock?

Projects unlock **gradually as you progress** through the course. As you learn new concepts and complete exercises, more projects become available to you. The idea is that each project becomes available once you've probably got enough knowledge to have a good crack at it.

You can use **any concepts you've learned** up to that point to solve a project. There's no restriction on which techniques you use — if you've learned it, it's fair game.

## They don't block your progress

This is quite an important thing to understand: projects **don't block your progression** through the course. They sit alongside the main path rather than on it. If you're not in the mood for a project, or you're finding one tricky, you can just carry on with the regular exercises and come back to it whenever you like.

You're never going to get stuck because of a project. They're there as **enrichment**, not as gates.

## Why bother with them?

Projects are where you really get to **test your understanding**. It's one thing to learn a concept in an exercise where you're guided towards the solution, but it's quite another to figure out how to combine several concepts together to build something that actually works.

They're great for:

- **Building confidence** — completing a project feels like a proper achievement
- **Deepening understanding** — you'll often find that working on a project helps you understand earlier concepts better
- **Having fun** — they're genuinely enjoyable challenges, and it's satisfying to see something substantial come together

## Some tips

- **Don't stress about them.** They're meant to be challenging, and it's completely fine if you don't get them straight away.
- **Use what you know.** You don't need any secret techniques — everything you've learned so far is enough.
- **Come back to them.** If you get stuck, go and learn some more through the regular exercises, then come back and have another go. You'll probably find it easier the second time around.
- **Revisit completed projects.** Even after you've finished one, you can always come back and try to improve your solution as you learn new things.

Projects are there to challenge you, help you grow, and — hopefully — be quite a lot of fun. Enjoy them!
