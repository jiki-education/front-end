One of the founding principles of Jiki is that **anyone should be able to learn to code for free**. That's not a marketing line - it's something we genuinely care about and it's baked into how we've built everything.

The full core course - all the concepts, all the exercises, everything you need to go from zero to confident programmer - is free and always will be.

But we also have a **Premium** tier, and I want to explain why it exists, what's in it, and how we think about it.

## Why freemium?

Before Jiki, I built **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)**, a free coding platform used by millions of people. One of the big lessons I took from that experience is that building something free is wonderful, but it's not enough on its own. You also need a **sustainable way to fund it**.

Without that, you end up constantly distracted by fundraising, grant applications, and figuring out how to keep the lights on. That's time and energy that should be going into making the product better for the people using it.

So with Jiki, I decided from the start to go with a **freemium model** - a genuinely free core product, with a Premium tier that funds the ongoing development and improvement of everything. It means we can focus on building something great rather than worrying about where the next bit of funding is coming from.

## What's always free

The **entire core course** is free. All the lessons, all the exercises, all the concepts you need to learn to code. There's no paywall hiding essential content, and there never will be.

If you work through the free course, you'll come out the other side knowing how to code. That's a promise.

## The Premium philosophy

So if the core course gives you everything you need, what's Premium for?

We have a pretty clear set of criteria for what goes into Premium. It needs to be something that:

- **Makes learning more fun** - extra challenges and variety that keep things interesting
- **Accelerates your learning** - tools that help you learn faster and get unstuck quicker
- **Covers more ground** - advanced topics and segue content that's nice to have all in one place
- **Gives you more access** - to me (Jeremy), to Jiki, and to our style of teaching

None of it is essential. All of it is **really quite good**.

## What's in Premium

### Projects

The core course teaches you concepts through focused exercises. **Projects** are where you get to pull it all together.

These are big, meaty challenges that **synthesise everything you've learned** so far. They're the sort of thing where you sit down, get stuck in, and come out the other end feeling like you've properly built something. They're fun, they're challenging, and they're a great way to solidify your understanding.

They're not a core part of the learning process - you don't need them to progress through the course. But they're probably my favourite part of Jiki, to be honest.

### Jiki AI

Getting stuck is a normal part of learning to code, but staying stuck isn't great. **Jiki AI** is there to help you get unstuck faster.

Instead of having to go to forums, search through documentation, or spend ages trying to figure out what's going wrong, you can ask Jiki AI for help right there in the exercise. It knows what you're working on, it knows what concepts you've been taught, and it'll nudge you in the right direction without just giving you the answer.

It's a way of **accelerating your learning** - spending less time stuck and more time actually coding. It's also something that costs us money every time you use it, so having it as part of Premium helps us cover those costs.

### Videos and live streams

Every month, I put out **videos and run live streams** for Premium members. These are a chance to dig into topics in a different way, ask questions, and get involved in the conversation.

If you like our style of teaching and want **more access to me and to Jiki**, this is where you get it. It's interactive, it's fun, and it's a nice way to feel part of something bigger than just working through exercises on your own.

## Pricing

We've thought quite carefully about how to price Premium. The goal is that the **vast majority of people** who can afford to have a laptop and be learning to code on it should also be able to afford Premium.

We have **regional pricing**, so it costs what we think is a fair amount for the region you're in. We haven't priced it so that only wealthy people can access it - we've priced it so that most people in each region should be able to get it, if that's where they choose to put their money.

## Wrapping up

The freemium model is how we keep Jiki free for everyone while also building something that keeps getting better. The core course teaches you to code. Premium makes the journey more fun, helps you learn faster, and gives you more of what we do best.

We think it's a model that works for everyone, and we're quite proud of how it's come together.

Thanks for reading :)
