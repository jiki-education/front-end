## Overview

Jiki is an online platform designed to help you learn to code through interactive exercises and tutorials.

Our platform comprises a website located at https://jiki.dev (and associated subdomains).

We're deeply committed to providing you with a safe and secure online platform for you to develop your software coding skills.

Jiki is run and managed by Jiki Ltd ("We", "Us"), a company registered in the UK. You might also want to read:

Our approach to your privacy is very straightforward to understand.

1. We do not collect more personal information than we need
2. We will not share any data you give us (e.g. your email address) with other third parties
3. We try to give you as much control about what information you share. For instance, we offer facilities to have an anonymous handle/user name if you want, and we don't require you to create a public profile.

It is important to note that any code submissions you make may be made **publicly** available under a Creative Commons license. However, using our privacy tools, you can decide if you want this content to be identifiably linked to you.

## The information we collect

### Information collected during account registration

During registration we collect some information about you, such as your name and email address. If you choose to sign up with a 3rd Party (e.g. GitHub OAuth) we will capture your name and email address from that service.

During sign-up you will also be asked to create a **handle**, which will act as a username for any content you share on the site. There is no requirement for your Handle to be personally identifiable.

We use your name and email to send you notifications and updates (if you choose to receive them) and any important Platform notices.

### Information we collect while you use our online Services

We may collect usage information about your use of our Service, such as the number of exercises you have attempted, your progress through the curriculum, and the amount of time spent on problems. This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.

This information may include:

- The URLs of the pages you are visiting
- Some information about your browser's version and operating system
- Information about your location (based on your IP address)

We use a number of 3rd party tools/services to collect this information. You can get information about them (including how to opt-out) by visiting the following pages:
