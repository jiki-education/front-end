Hi everyone!

I wanted to share a bit about why Jiki exists and where I hope it'll go. It's quite a personal story for me, and I think understanding the "why" might help you understand what we're trying to do here.

## Before Jiki, there was Exercism

For those who don't know, I've spent the last decade building **[Exercism](https://exercism.org)** - a platform that helps developers deepen their skills and learn new programming languages. It's grown into something I'm really proud of, with millions of people using it to level up their coding.

But here's the thing: whilst Exercism was designed for developers who already know how to code, we kept attracting **total beginners**. Over **500 people a day** were signing up who'd never written a line of code before. And honestly, Exercism wasn't built for them. We were sending them off to learn the basics elsewhere, hoping they'd come back when they were ready.

That never sat quite right with me. My motivation with Exercism has always been about **social mobility** - helping people who need that help the most. Programming can genuinely change lives and open doors that might otherwise stay closed. So watching these beginners arrive, full of enthusiasm, and then having to tell them "sorry, this isn't for you yet" felt like a failure on my part.

I started exploring the "learn to code" landscape to understand what was out there for them. And whilst there's a **huge** amount of resources - courses, videos, tutorials, bootcamps - I realised something was missing. Most of them don't get to the heart of what I believe programming actually is: **fun problem solving**.

Instead, they give you videos to watch, quizzes to take, and certificates to print out. They teach you syntax and theory, but they don't really let you _make_ things. And I think that's why so many people give up. It's not that coding is too hard - it's that the way they're being taught doesn't feel like coding at all.

So I realised that one of the most important things I could do was to help those 500 people a day who were signing up to Exercism, looking for somewhere to start.

## Designing Jiki from experience

When I think about how I learned to code, it wasn't through courses or tutorials. I started at about eight years old, and I learned by **building things**. Games, websites, little tools - whatever I found interesting. Nobody gave me a curriculum. I just made stuff, got stuck, figured it out, and made more stuff.

That experience has shaped everything about how I think about learning. I believe people learn to code by **coding** - not by watching someone else do it, not by answering multiple choice questions, but by actually writing code and solving problems.

That's why Jiki is built around **projects from day one**. You're not doing tiny five-line exercises for months on end. You're building things - games, animations, tools - and writing **dozens, then hundreds** of lines of code in your first couple of months. It's challenging, but it's the kind of challenge that makes you feel like you're actually becoming a programmer.

## What Jiki is and where I want it to go

Jiki is an interactive coding bootcamp for total beginners. You learn by building projects in a custom environment designed specifically to help you understand what's happening. There's a little character called **Jiki** who shows you how your code executes, making the invisible visible.

But more than the features, what I really care about is the philosophy behind it. I genuinely believe it's **valuable for almost anyone** to learn to code. Not because everyone needs to become a software developer, but because understanding how to break down problems and build solutions is a skill that transfers to everything.

My goal is to make the **best possible course for beginners**. Not the most comprehensive, not the one that covers the most ground, but the one that actually gets people over the initial hurdles and gives them a solid foundation. Then we'll build follow-on courses around core skills.

I'm not trying to replace the plethora of other things out there, or teach the latest frameworks. What I want is for everyone who goes through Jiki to have **really solid fundamentals**. Because when you have those fundamentals, learning everything else is _so_ much easier.

## Give it a try

I'd love you to try Jiki and see what you think.

If you're relatively new to coding (or a total beginner), then I hope you'll really enjoy learning from this. I'd love to know where you get stuck or frustrated - that feedback is invaluable for making it better.

If you're an existing developer, I should be upfront: this isn't designed for you. It'll probably feel quite basic and slow. But trust me, for newbies it feels fast and intense! I'd still love you to have a play and give me feedback. Sometimes experienced eyes spot things that beginners wouldn't think to mention.

And if you know someone who's been thinking about learning to code, I'd really appreciate you sharing Jiki with them. That word-of-mouth support means everything.

If you believe in what we're doing and want to support the mission financially, that's incredibly helpful too. Building something like this takes time and resources, and every bit of support helps us keep going.

I'm really excited about where this is going. I think we can genuinely help a lot of people, and I can't wait to see what you all build.

Thanks for reading :)
