# Welcome to Jiki!

Today marks an exciting milestone: **Jiki is officially live!** We've been working hard to create a platform that makes learning to code accessible, engaging, and effective for complete beginners.

## What is Jiki?

Jiki is an interactive learn-to-code platform created by the team behind [Exercism](https://exercism.org). While Exercism helps developers practice and master programming languages, Jiki focuses on helping absolute beginners take their first steps into the world of coding.

## Why We Built Jiki

Over the years at Exercism, we've seen thousands of people try to start their coding journey, only to hit a wall because they lacked foundational skills. We realized there was a gap: existing resources were either too theoretical or assumed prior knowledge.

We built Jiki to fill that gap. Our goal is to provide:

- **Hands-on learning** through interactive coding exercises
- **Structured progression** from zero to confident beginner
- **Clear explanations** that don't assume prior knowledge
- **Immediate feedback** to help you learn from mistakes

## How Jiki Works

Jiki uses a unique approach to teaching code:

1. **Interactive Exercises**: Write real code in your browser and see it run immediately
2. **Step-by-Step Learning**: Follow a carefully designed curriculum that builds on each concept
3. **Visual Feedback**: Watch your code execute frame-by-frame to understand exactly what's happening
4. **Project-Based Practice**: Apply what you learn by building actual projects

## Who is Jiki For?

Jiki is perfect for:

- Complete beginners with zero coding experience
- People who tried learning to code before but got stuck
- Anyone who wants a structured, supportive path to becoming a developer
- Students redirected from Exercism who need to build foundational skills first

## What Can You Learn?

We're launching with comprehensive tracks in **JavaScript** and **Python**, covering:

- Variables and data types
- Functions and code organization
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Working with data structures (arrays, objects)
- And much more!

## Pricing and Accessibility

We believe everyone should have access to quality coding education, regardless of where they live or their financial situation. That's why Jiki uses purchasing power parity (PPP) pricing:

- **US pricing**: $10/month
- **Adjusted pricing**: As low as $2/month in lower-income regions
- **Free trial**: Try Jiki before you commit

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! We have exciting features planned, including:

- More programming languages
- Advanced project tracks
- Community features
- Live Q&A sessions with instructors

## Join Us!
