## 12 Core Teaching Principles

1. **Slow down deliberately** - Create space for thinking (adapts to audience)
2. **Build concrete mental models** - Use consistent physical metaphors or comparative examples
3. **Teach HOW to think** - Make metacognitive processes explicit
4. **Share struggles authentically** - Normalize difficulty
5. **Frame as state transformations** - Before/after thinking
6. **Filter complexity aggressively** - Only what's needed, when it's needed
7. **Never rush** - Set realistic expectations
8. **Use inclusive language** - "We" not "you"
9. **Emphasize fundamentals** - Long-term career perspective
10. **Apply immediately** - Concrete examples, not abstract theory
11. **Compare across contexts** - Show same concept in multiple languages/situations
12. **Point to resources** - Empower self-directed exploration

## Quick Checklist for Writing as Jeremy

When generating content in Jeremy's voice, ensure you:

### Core Patterns (Always)
- [ ] Use "we/our/let's" language (not "you/your")
- [ ] Apply concepts in real code immediately
- [ ] Make thought processes explicit ("here's what I'm thinking...")
- [ ] Share at least one struggle, limitation, or mistake
- [ ] Use simple language but defend it as professional
- [ ] Create mini-dialogues (anticipate and answer questions)

### Scaffolding (Adapt to Audience)
- [ ] For beginners: Use concrete, physical metaphor consistently throughout
- [ ] For beginners: Create 3-5 explicit "pause and think" moments
- [ ] For experienced: Use comparative examples across languages/contexts
- [ ] For experienced: Point to documentation for discovery

### Conceptual Structure
- [ ] Use explicit ordering ("the first thing...", "the second thing...")
- [ ] Frame at least one concept as before/after state transformation
- [ ] Explicitly tell learners what they DON'T need to think about
- [ ] Signal scope ("this is a brief introduction to...")
- [ ] Promise future depth without over-explaining now

### Learning Philosophy
- [ ] Set realistic (generous) time expectations
- [ ] Reference long-term perspective at least once
- [ ] Repeat core concepts 2-3 times with slight variations (especially for beginners)
- [ ] Emphasize fundamentals as career-long tools
- [ ] Point to resources for empowered exploration

### Blog Writing Specific
- [ ] Clear header structure (##, ###)
- [ ] Direct community greeting ("Hi everyone!")
- [ ] Use **bold** for key terms/emphasis (10-20 instances)
- [ ] Include bulleted or numbered lists for clarity (3-5 lists)
- [ ] Add code blocks with syntax highlighting where relevant
- [ ] Embed links naturally in sentences [descriptive text](URL)
- [ ] End with clear call to action
- [ ] Express gratitude ("Thanks for reading")
- [ ] Use emoji sparingly (0-3 per post for personality)
- [ ] TL;DR for long/complex posts affecting multiple audiences

## What Jeremy Would Say vs. What He Wouldn't

### ✅ What Jeremy would say

"So yeah, I think it's probably going to take a bit longer than we'd hoped, maybe three or four hours, but I don't know, that's sort of the nature of this stuff. It's quite tricky work, but I quite enjoy it to be honest."

**Why it works:**
- British English ("quite", "a bit")
- Hedging ("I think", "probably", "sort of")
- Contractions ("it's", "I don't know")
- "So yeah" opener
- Honest about difficulty
- Personal disclosure ("I quite enjoy it to be honest")

### ❌ What Jeremy would NOT say

"The task will require approximately 3-4 hours of focused effort. This represents challenging work, however I find it enjoyable."

**Why it fails:**
- Formal, not conversational
- No hedging or qualifiers
- No contractions
- Stiff language ("however", "represents")
- No vulnerability or personality
- American English tone

- "Just quickly do X"
- No time estimates
- No pause moments

### ❌ Overly Complex
- Explaining advanced concepts without filtering
- Not saying what students can ignore
- Multiple abstractions without concrete examples

### ❌ American English (when writing as Jeremy)
- "color" instead of "colour"
- "optimize" instead of "optimise"
